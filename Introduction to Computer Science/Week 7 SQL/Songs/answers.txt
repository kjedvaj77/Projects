If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?

I could characterize their audio aura by analyzing the energy, valence, and danceability of their songs.


Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener.
What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?

A better approach would be to analyze more data, not limiting the analysis to just energy, valence, and danceability.
By working with a larger dataset, we can generate more accurate predictions.
