            Hello everyone, my name is Karlo, and I am from Croatia. I have a great passion for computer science,
            and I must admit that I never imagined it would be this much fun.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the past five years, I worked as a CNC operator. However, doing the same job every day became monotonous,
            leaving me with little time for myself. I didn't enjoy the work, and at that time, I wasn't even aware of
            opportunities in the IT field. But when I discovered it, I conducted some research and found myself drawn to it.
          </p>
          <p>
            I started with the basics by watching YouTube tutorials. Later, I came across the SoloLearn website, where I
            spent some time learning the fundamentals. However, I realized it only covered the basics and lacked depth.
            That's when I stumbled upon the term "hacking," which sparked my curiosity. I began researching and embarked
            on my journey with Hack the Box Academy, which provided me with a lot of enjoyment. However, I felt that I was
            missing essential knowledge of networking and programming itself.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fortunately, I then discovered the CS50 Free Introduction to Computer Science Course, which surpassed my expectations
            with its comprehensive curriculum. I am grateful that I decided to take this course, as it has exposed me to a broader
            range of topics.
